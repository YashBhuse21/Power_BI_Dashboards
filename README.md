  'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
  'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
  "unknown"
   )

- IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
  TRUE(),
  'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
  'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",

  FILTER(
  ALL('public cc_detail'),
  'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])))

- Previous_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
  SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
  FILTER(
  ALL('public cc_detail'),
  'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1))
